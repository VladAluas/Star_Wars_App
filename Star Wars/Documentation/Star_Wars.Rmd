# Introduction

<br>

In this article we will explore some data from the **Star Wars** franchise. We will check the some interesting data about the caracters in the franchise and we will compare the three series, the **Prequels** (I know BOOO!!!!), the **Original Trilogy** and the **Sequels**. In order to do so, we will use an existing dataset from `R`, the `starwars` data frame. We can see the data frame below:

```{r}
starwars %>%
  kable(format = "html") %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = T, bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive"))
```
